# About me

I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia. 
My current interest falls in Time Series deep learning and interpretation using state-of-the-art techniques.

Prior to UVA, I have worked in Samsung Research, Bangladesh for 2 years as a iOS software developer, 2018-2020. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology at 2018. In my spare time I enjoy playing Chess and Table Tennis.
