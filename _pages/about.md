I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science). 
My current interest falls in Time Series deep learning and interpretation using state-of-the-art techniques. Currently, I am advised by [Professor Judy Fox](https://judyfox.online/) and [Professor Geoffrey Fox](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/geoffrey-c-fox) as my Co-Adviser. My prior experiences include improving code review and software development processes.  For inquiries about my research, please feel free to email me at <i>khairulislam@virginia.edu</i>. See my recent works on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pLgKvU8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to UVA, I have worked in [Samsung Research, Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) for 2 years as a iOS software developer, 2018-2020. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) at 2018. In my spare time I enjoy playing Chess and Table Tennis.

## News

* May 2024 - I graduated from UVA with a Master's (En Route) degree in Computer Science.
* Dec 2023 - Paper accepted in *AAAI'24 WORKSHOP: AI FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS (AI4TS)*. Title: *[Interpreting Time Series Transformer Models and Sensitivity Analysis of Population Age Groups to COVID-19 Infections](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.15119v1)*
* Nov 2023 - Alhamdulillah, got married to my long time acquaintance *Dr. Tabassum*. You see, this is the most important news here :3. 
* Nov 2023 - Passed my Ph.D. qualifier exam defense. My thesis title was : *"Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling of Time Series Deep Learning Models"*. In this work, I showed a better way to interpret time series models by explicitly considering temporal importance. 
* Oct 2023 - Paper accepted in *AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium*, 2024. Title : *[Temporal Dependencies and Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Time Series Models](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30396)*.
* July 2023 - Third prize in [NSF Student Research Award](https://conferences.computer.org/icdh/2023/student_awards.html) at *IEEE International Conference on Digital Health*. 
* June 2023 - Gave my Ph.D. qualifier exam proposed on time series interpretation.
