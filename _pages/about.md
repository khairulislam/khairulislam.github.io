I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science). 
My current interest falls in Time Series deep learning and interpretation using state-of-the-art techniques. For inquiries about my research, please feel free to email me at <i>khairulislam@virginia.edu</i>. See my recent works on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pLgKvU8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to UVA, I have worked in [Samsung Research, Bangladesh](https://research.samsung.com/srbd) for 2 years as a iOS software developer, 2018-2020. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) at 2018. In my spare time I enjoy playing Chess and Table Tennis.
